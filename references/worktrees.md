# Linked Worktree Contract

Use this contract whenever a workflow requires an isolated Git worktree. The calling skill supplies the repository, exact start point, local branch name, worktree path, remote push target, and task-specific retention policy.

1. Treat the original checkout as a control checkout only. Inspect its status, branch, remotes, and refs, but do not switch branches, fast-forward it, stash changes, clean it, or alter pre-existing user work.
2. Fetch the refs required by the calling workflow without checking them out. Resolve the chosen start point to a commit SHA before creating the worktree. For an existing PR, require that SHA to match the head OID reported by GitHub before doing repository-backed analysis.
3. Choose a unique local branch and a unique sibling path outside the repository. Never place a linked worktree inside the repository. If the branch or path exists, do not reuse, delete, reset, or force it; choose another unique name or stop for direction.
4. Create the branch and linked worktree from the explicit start point:

   ```bash
   repo="/absolute/path/to/control-checkout"
   start_ref="<verified-ref-or-sha>"
   branch="<unique-local-branch>"
   repo_name="$(basename "$repo")"
   worktree="$(dirname "$repo")/${repo_name}-worktrees/<unique-task-name>"

   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$worktree")"
   git -C "$repo" worktree add -b "$branch" "$worktree" "$start_ref"
   ```

5. Verify both isolation and provenance before continuing:

   ```bash
   test "$(git -C "$worktree" rev-parse HEAD)" = \
     "$(git -C "$repo" rev-parse "${start_ref}^{commit}")"
   test -z "$(git -C "$worktree" status --porcelain)"
   git -C "$worktree" status --short --branch
   ```

6. After setup, run every repository read, search, analysis, edit, build, test, commit, and push from the linked worktree. Keep run logs and generated evidence outside every checkout unless they are intentional project files.
7. Allow only one writer at a time in a worktree. Read-only workers may run concurrently only when their tools will not create caches, lockfiles, generated files, or other writes.
8. For work tied to a mutable remote branch, re-fetch and compare its current OID with the last expected OID before the first edit and before each push. If it moved unexpectedly, stop and reconcile through the calling workflow; never hide divergence with a force push or history rewrite.
9. Push with the explicit remote and destination supplied by the calling workflow. Do not assume the unique local branch has the same name or remote as the branch being updated.
10. Report the control checkout, linked worktree, local branch, start SHA, and final disposition. Leave the worktree in place by default. Remove it only when the calling workflow or user explicitly requires cleanup, and never use forced removal for a dirty worktree.
